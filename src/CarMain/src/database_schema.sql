-- The big idea behind this schema is that the database is stored in a single file.
-- Every time the "new session" command is send from the pit, a new .db file is
-- created. Associated with this file is a timestamp in the form YYYY-MM-DDTHH:SSZ
-- (conforming to the ISO 8601 standard)
-- The z means "Zulu time", otherwise known as an offset of 0 from UTC. (The name of 
-- the file is really only used as a unique identifier, so it's not actually that
-- important)
--
-- [The paragraph below is still theoretical and a WIP]
-- All of these sessions are stored locally on a flash drive on the car. Once 
-- somebody with the flash drive has access to the Postgres server, they can sync
-- up all of the locally stored data with the rest of the data. The syncing process
-- will also clear the data on the flash drive, eliminating the need to manually 
-- clean it. Each .db file will be treated as its own unique session in the Postgres
-- database
--
-- [Fever dream goal below]
-- Eventually, it would be really cool to set up a web service that uses the postgres
-- database in combination with a data visualizer (Grafana?). It would also be really
-- cool to have this as a service that other teams could set up with their own 
-- telemetry systems.
